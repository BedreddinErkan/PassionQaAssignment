Related to the assignment,


-> In this framework i want to use Cucumber BDD framework because its understandable for non-technical people.

->Inside the build App Page is automated 1 test set flows which is choose AppCategory,non-technical people choose,add or delete which app category they want.

-> Unfortunately Website is not capable for automation for in my opinion.I can automated app Category.But still i writing code the other case flows also so in that way you can see my code structure and knowledge.

-> As a design pattern I want to use Page Object Model.Under the BasePage, implement common elements and call this page with the Dashboard Page and I created each seperated page to creating method and element under specisific page.In that way qa engineer know to go where.

-> Under the utilities package there are some utilities methods.The reason is that make our framework more abstract and parametecric.

-> The reason I use CIBuild.xml for to run test cases.Because with the TestListener class ,we are able to execute test cases with checkbox on Jenkins

-> As a report type i use Cucumber Extent Report and you can see the report under the target/report.html.You need to open with browser.

-> With the ScreenShot Class you can add screenshot every report type.For see the ScreenShots you need to identfy path which is inside the ScreenShot Class.

-I tried to do my best. I hope you will like this assignment.If you have a question or anyth. please contact me.

Thanks for giving me this opportunity.

Regards.
